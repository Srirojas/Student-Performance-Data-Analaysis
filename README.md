# Student Performance Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes how various factors—gender, ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation—affect student performance in math, reading, and writing scores. By using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization, we uncover meaningful insights that can help improve academic outcomes.

## Objective
- Analyze how different features impact student performance.
- Visualize trends using various plots (bar charts, histograms, boxplots, and pairplots).
- Identify patterns in scores based on demographic and socioeconomic factors.

## Dataset
- Total Entries: 1,000 students
- Features Considered : Numerical being Math Score, Reading Score, Writing Score & Categorical being Gender, Ethnicity, Parental Level of Education, Lunch Type, Test Preparation. Excluded Feature: CustomerID (not relevant for analysis)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✔ General Data Distribution – Understanding feature distributions
✔ Score Distributions – Identifying trends in Math, Reading, and Writing scores
✔ Impact of Gender, Ethnicity, and Parental Education on performance
✔ Effect of Lunch Type & Test Preparation Course on student scores

## Key Insights
### 1.Gender-Based Analysis
Female students have a slightly higher average score than male students across all subjects.

### 2.Ethnicity & Performance
Group E students scored slightly higher on average, while other ethnic groups performed similarly.

### 3.Parental Education & Performance
Students whose parents have higher education levels tend to score better than those whose parents only completed schooling.

### 4.Impact of Test Preparation Course
Students who completed the test preparation course performed significantly better, confirming its positive impact.

### 5.Lunch Type & Performance
Students who opted for standard lunch had higher scores compared to those with free/reduced lunch, possibly indicating nutritional influence on academic performance.

## Visualizations
✔ Score Distributions (Histograms & Boxplots)
✔ Average Scores by Gender & Ethnicity (Bar Charts)
✔ Parental Education vs. Scores (Pie Charts)
✔ Test Preparation Impact (Strip Plots)
✔ Math, Reading, Writing Score Correlations (Pairplots)

## Conclusion
Key Takeaways:
- Gender, Ethnicity, and Parental Education slightly influence student scores.
- Test Preparation Course and Lunch Type have a moderate to significant impact on performance.
- Providing standard lunch and test preparation courses can enhance student academic outcomes.

## Technologies Used
